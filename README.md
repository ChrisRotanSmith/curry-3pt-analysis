## 🛠️ Tools and Skills
- BigQuery SQL (Data Querying, Aggregation)
- Data Cleaning (Handling NULLs)
- Data Visualization (Tableau Public)
- Data Storytelling (Dashboard Annotations)

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. Built a BigQuery table with Curry’s 2024–25 season stats.
2. Queried three-point percentage (3PT%) and points per game (PPG) between phases.
3. Calculated +3.5% improvement in 3PT% during playoffs.
4. Built a Tableau Dashboard with two bar charts:
   - Three-Point Percentage Comparison
   - Points Per Game Comparison
5. Added narrative text summarizing key insights.
